**Mockup api for loan data:** [loan-mock](http://www.mocky.io/v2/5c923b0932000029056bce39)

## Planning

 First I started to draw the page, using [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)  to divide the components, the I achieve a result that you can take a close look at [loan-dashboard](https://whimsical.com/loan-dashboard-522b7L6BFkDQ4dWeDgBZWq).
 Finally I did the planning and create user stories on notion
